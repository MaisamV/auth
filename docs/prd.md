# **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

## **OAuth 2.0 Authentication Microservice**

Author: Product Owner  
Status: Scoping  
Version: 1.0

### **1\. Overview & Strategic Vision**

This document outlines the requirements for a new, centralized **Authentication Microservice**. This service will become the cornerstone of our platform's security, managing user identity and controlling access to all protected APIs across our microservices ecosystem.

Our strategic vision is to build a highly secure, scalable, and standards-compliant authentication authority that can serve our current and future products, starting with the AI-powered Instagram messaging platform.

### **2\. Problem Statement**

As our platform grows, we face several challenges:

* **Inconsistent Authentication:** Different services may implement their own ad-hoc authentication logic, leading to security vulnerabilities and high maintenance overhead.  
* **Scalability Bottlenecks:** A monolithic or poorly designed authentication system will not handle the high load from millions of user interactions (DMs, comments).  
* **Lack of Centralized Control:** We cannot easily manage user sessions, enforce security policies, or revoke access for specific users across the entire platform in real-time.  
* **Insecure Third-Party Access:** We need a secure way to allow third-party developers or internal machine-to-machine services to access our APIs without sharing user credentials.

This microservice will solve these problems by providing a single, robust, and scalable source of truth for authentication and authorization.

### **3\. Goals & Success Metrics**

#### **Goals**

* Provide a secure, centralized authentication and authorization solution for the entire platform.  
* Implement the OAuth 2.0 framework to ensure industry-standard security.  
* Achieve high availability and low latency to handle millions of daily active users.  
* Enable secure access for first-party clients (web dashboard, mobile apps) and third-party services.  
* Establish a foundation that can be extended to support other identity providers (e.g., Sign in with Google) in the future.

#### **Success Metrics**

* **Latency:** Token generation and validation requests should complete in \<50ms at the 99th percentile.  
* **Availability:** The service must maintain \>99.99% uptime.  
* **Adoption:** All new microservices must integrate with this service for authentication.  
* **Security:** Zero critical security vulnerabilities reported in penetration tests.  
* **Scalability:** The service must scale horizontally to handle a 10x increase in traffic without performance degradation.

### **4\. User Personas & Stories**

| Persona | Description | User Stories |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Instagram Page Owner** | Our primary end-user who signs up and uses our dashboard. | \- As an Instagram Page Owner, I want to create an account with my email and password so I can use the service.\<br\>- As an Instagram Page Owner, I want to log in securely to access my dashboard.\<br\>- As an Instagram Page Owner, I want to remain logged in for an extended period so I don't have to re-enter my password frequently.\<br\>- As an Instagram Page Owner, I want my session to be terminated on all devices if I change my password. |
| **Frontend Developer** | Builds the user-facing dashboard. | \- As a Frontend Developer, I need a simple and secure way to authenticate users and manage their sessions.\<br\>- As a Frontend Developer, I need to refresh an expired access token without forcing the user to log in again. |
| **Backend Developer** | Builds other microservices (e.g., messaging, billing). | \- As a Backend Developer, I need a reliable way to protect my API endpoints and verify that incoming requests are from an authenticated user.\<br\>- As a Backend Developer, I need to get the user's unique ID from a token to process their request. |
| **System Administrator** | Manages the platform's infrastructure and security. | \- As a System Administrator, I need the ability to immediately revoke a user's access across the entire platform if their account is compromised. |
| **Third-Party Developer** | (Future) Builds integrations with our platform. | \- As a Third-Party Developer, I want to allow users to grant my application limited access to their data without sharing their password. |

### **5\. Scope & Features**

This microservice will be responsible for:

* User registration (email/password).  
* User login and credential verification.  
* Issuing, validating, and refreshing OAuth 2.0 tokens (Access & Refresh Tokens).  
* Supporting specific OAuth 2.0 grant types (see FEATURES.md).  
* Providing secure endpoints for token management.  
* Securely storing user credentials.

### **6\. Out of Scope (What We're Not Doing)**

* **Social Logins (v1.0):** Integration with "Sign in with Google/Facebook" is a future requirement.  
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) (v1.0):** Will be added in a subsequent version.  
* **User Profile Management:** Storing user profile data (e.g., name, avatar) is the responsibility of a separate user-service. This service only handles credentials.  
* **Fine-grained Permissions (RBAC/ABAC):** This service will only authenticate *who* the user is. A separate service will manage *what* the user is allowed to do.
