# **Technology Stack**

This document outlines the chosen technology stack for the OAuth 2.0 Authentication Microservice, with justifications for each choice.

## **Language**

* **Go (Golang)**  
  * **Justification:** Go is an excellent choice for high-performance network services. Its strong concurrency model (goroutines and channels), static typing, and focus on simplicity make it ideal for building scalable and maintainable microservices. The fast compilation and single binary deployment simplify our CI/CD pipeline.

## **Database**

* **PostgreSQL**  
  * **Justification:** We require a robust, ACID-compliant relational database to store user credentials, client information, and relationships. PostgreSQL is a mature, feature-rich, and highly reliable open-source RDBMS that meets all our needs for data integrity.  
* **Go Library: sqlx**  
  * **Justification:** sqlx provides extensions to the standard database/sql library, making it easier to work with structs and slices without the overhead of a full ORM. This allows us to write clean, efficient SQL while reducing boilerplate code.

## **Caching & In-Memory Storage**

* **Redis**  
  * **Justification:** Redis will be used for performance-critical operations, such as storing the token revocation list (blocklist). Its speed as an in-memory data store is unmatched for this purpose. It can also be used for caching frequently accessed, non-critical data to reduce database load.  
* **Go Library: go-redis**  
  * **Justification:** go-redis is the de-facto standard Redis client for Go, offering a full feature set and excellent performance.

## **API & Routing**

* **Chi Router**  
  * **Justification:** chi is a lightweight, idiomatic, and powerful HTTP router for Go. It provides necessary features like middleware, URL parameters, and context management without imposing a large framework on our application, which aligns perfectly with our Clean Architecture goals.

## **Security & Cryptography**

* **golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt**  
  * **Justification:** The bcrypt package from the official Go crypto repository is the standard for secure password hashing. It is battle-tested and resistant to brute-force attacks.  
* **golang-jwt/jwt**  
  * **Justification:** A widely-used library for creating and parsing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). It is well-maintained and supports the necessary signing algorithms (e.g., HMAC, RSA).

## **Configuration Management**

* **spf13/viper**  
  * **Justification:** Viper provides a comprehensive solution for managing application configuration. It can read from environment variables, config files (YAML, JSON, etc.), and remote config systems, giving us flexibility in different deployment environments.

## **Testing**

* **Go Standard Library (testing)**  
  * **Justification:** The built-in testing package is sufficient for most of our unit and integration testing needs.  
* **stretchr/testify**  
  * **Justification:** The assert and require packages from this library provide a rich set of assertion functions that make tests more readable and concise.
