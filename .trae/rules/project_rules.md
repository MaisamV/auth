If you want to run the project you **must** use bellow command
```sh
docker-compose up --build -d auth-service
```
If you want to **only** build the project to see if there is any build errors or not you should build the output file in .\bin folder.

If you don't remember the context or goal of the project or you are missing part of the details, you **MUST** read the project README.md and all the docs in .\docs folder.
